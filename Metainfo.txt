Penalization method.'

Description : 'Performs LASSO regression in a moving window by using BIC criterion to 
choose penalty parameter (lambda). The simulated data contains a break 
point after which the cardinality of active set q changes. Plots time series 
of lambda in LASSO regression. Furthermore, the cardinality of the active 
set q, the L2-norm of the residuals, the L1-norm of the parameter beta 
and the condition number of the squared design matrix [t(X)X] are plotted. 
All of the plots contain results from a number of simulations and the 
average over all of them.'
